Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.
Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element

Approach
The idea is to keep track of the largest and second largest element while traversing the array. Initialize largest and secondLargest with -1. Now, for any index i,
If arr[i] > largest, update secondLargest with largest and largest with arr[i].
Else If arr[i] < largest and arr[i] > secondLargest, update secondLargest with arr[i]. 

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
